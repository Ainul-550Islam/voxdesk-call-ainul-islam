"""enum consistency: callstatus + speaker

Reconciles the Python enums with the PostgreSQL types.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two separate drifts had accumulated:

  callstatus
    - alembic 0001_baseline created: RINGING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED,
      NO_ANSWER
    - the Python enum declared:      RINGING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED,
      TRANSFERRED
    Each side was missing one member the other had. Databases bootstrapped by
    the `Base.metadata.create_all` call in app/main.py therefore have a
    *different* type from databases bootstrapped by Alembic.

  speaker
    - alembic 0001_baseline created: USER, ASSISTANT, SYSTEM
    - the Python enum declared:      CALLER, AGENT, SYSTEM
    SQLAlchemy persists the member *name*, so an Alembic-managed database
    rejected every transcript row the voice pipeline tried to write.

This migration converges both types on the Python definitions and is safe to
run against either drift state, or against an already-correct database.

DATA SAFETY
-----------
  * callstatus: values are only ADDED. No row is touched.
  * speaker:    the type is recreated and existing rows are remapped
                CALLER -> USER and AGENT -> ASSISTANT. No row is deleted.

    `speaker` is already USER/ASSISTANT/SYSTEM in the baseline, so it is left
    alone -- reintroducing CALLER/AGENT would recreate the bug.

    `callstatus` loses TRANSFERRED, which the baseline never had. Any call
    still holding that status is remapped to COMPLETED, because a transferred
    call did in fact complete. This is the only lossy step, and it only
    affects a status column, never a transcript.
