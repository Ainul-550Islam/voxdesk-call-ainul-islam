# VoxDesk — Deployment (staging & production)

This document is the operator runbook for taking VoxDesk from development →
staging → production. It covers the deployment dependency graph, environment
separation, the safe deploy/rollback sequence, migrations, backup/restore, TLS
and the security controls that hold it together. Anything that is *enforced*
here is enforced by code (`Settings.validate_security()`, `scripts/migrate.py`,
`scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/restore.sh`) and verified by
`tests/test_deployment.py` — not just prose.

## 1. Deployment dependency graph

Built from the repository, not assumed. Arrows mean "depends on to serve or
run correctly":

```
                     ┌──────────────┐
                     │    caddy     │  TLS termination, security headers,
                     │  (80/443)    │  request-size ceiling, WebSocket passthrough
                     └──────┬───────┘
                            │ reverse_proxy api:8000  (and grafana:3000 when
                            │ GRAFANA_DOMAIN is set)

        └──────┬──────┘ │ limit   │ │   │ grafana  │ (127.0.0.1:3000, internal)
               │        └─────────┘ │   └──────────┘
        ┌──────▼──────────────────┐ │
        │  scheduler (worker)     │ │  reminders, campaigns, CRM sync,
        │  depends_on api+db+redis│ │  knowledge ingestion, billing
        └─────────────────────────┘ │  reconciliation, retention
        ┌───────────────────────────▼─┐
        │  backup (nightly pg_dump)   │  depends_on db: service_healthy
        └─────────────────────────────┘
```

Ordering is enforced in `docker-compose.prod.yml`: `api` waits for `db` and
`redis` to be *healthy*; `scheduler` waits for `db` healthy and `api` started;
`backup`, `prometheus` and `caddy` wait for their upstreams. `db` and `redis`
expose **no host ports** — they are reachable only on the compose network —
and `api`/`grafana` bind to `127.0.0.1` so nothing can bypass Caddy.

## 2. Environments

Three environments, strictly separated:

| | development | staging | production |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compose file | `docker-compose.yml` | `docker-compose.staging.yml` | `docker-compose.prod.yml` |
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | `staging` | `production` |
| Env file | `.env` | `.env.staging` | `.env` |
| Schema owner | `create_all` (dev convenience) | **Alembic only** | **Alembic only** |
| DB/Redis/volumes | local | `*_staging` (separate) | `pgdata`/`redisdata` |
| Secrets | dev placeholders | **its own** (`secrets-staging/`) | `secrets/` |
| Stripe | — | test-mode keys only | live keys |
| E2E guard (Step 5) | allowed | allowed (default off) | **refused at boot** |
| Failure injection | allowed | allowed | refused |
| Host ports | `8000`, `3000` | `8001`, `3001`, `8080/8443` | `8000`, `3000`, `80/443` |

Rules:

* **Never copy production secrets into staging.** Staging uses its own
  `.env.staging`, its own `secrets-staging/` directory, its own volumes
  (`pgdata_staging`, …), its own database and its own test-mode provider
  credentials (Twilio test account, Stripe `sk_test_*`, etc.). Template:
  `.env.staging.example`.
* `validate_security()` treats staging as **not production** (E2E and failure
  injection are permitted) but also as **not development** (no `create_all`,
  Alembic owns the schema). Staging therefore exercises the same migration,
  readiness and proxy path production does, without touching production data.
* `KNOWN_APP_ENVS = {development, test, staging, production, prod}` — any other
  `APP_ENV` fails at boot.

### Sandbox limitations (this repository's environment)

This workspace has no Docker daemon, so container-level staging/production
validation cannot run here. PostgreSQL 17 **is** available locally, so
migration and restore logic can be exercised against it. Everywhere else the
validation is static and deterministic (see `tests/test_deployment.py`). Real
runtime claims are never fabricated: when a check needs Docker or a live
stack, that blocker is stated explicitly rather than simulated.

## 3. Production configuration (fail-closed)

`Settings.validate_security()` runs at startup and, in production, **refuses
to boot** on any of:

* `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` not `true`
* `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
* `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` not `https://`, or containing `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`
* any `CORS_ORIGINS` entry that is not `https://`
* placeholder-looking secrets (markers like `change-me`, `xxxx`,
  `placeholder`, …) in `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`,
  `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, the LLM keys, `STRIPE_*`
* `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` empty, or `TWILIO_SKIP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY` enabled
* `E2E_ENABLED` set (real-call E2E is operator-run in a test environment only)
* `KNOWLEDGE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=hashing` (development stub)
* `CRM_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` empty (provider credentials would be stored plaintext)
* `BILLING_PROVIDER=stripe` with a `sk_test_*` key, or
  `BILLING_UNLIMITED_ENTITLEMENTS` enabled
* `JWT_SECRET` still the default or shorter than 32 chars; `SECRET_KEY` default

There is **no second configuration system** — everything lives in
`app/core/config.py` on the existing `Settings` architecture. `uses_https` is
derived from the actual `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` scheme, so the Secure-cookie flag
(`auth_routes.py`) and the HSTS header (`security_headers.py`) follow the real
TLS posture instead of guessing from the environment name.

## 4. Deploy sequence (safe, single-VM)

`scripts/deploy.sh` (idempotent; flags `--no-build`, `--no-backup`, `--no-pull`):

1. `git pull --ff-only` (skipped under rollback)
2. build images
3. **pre-deploy backup** of the database, then **verify** the dump with
   `pg_restore --list`. A deploy that cannot back up (or whose backup fails
   verification) aborts before touching the schema — the backup is the
   rollback point.
4. **migrations under an advisory lock** — `scripts/migrate.py` (below)
5. recreate containers onto the new image
6. wait up to 120 s for `/health/ready`
7. verify `/health` and report

On any failure the script prints the rollback command. It **never** downgrades
the database automatically.

### Honest zero-downtime statement

This is a **single-VM, single-Postgres topology**, so it **does not guarantee
zero-downtime**. `docker compose up -d` recreates the `api` container, which
means a brief (seconds) connection drop on the public path while Caddy
retries. There is no blue/green deployment, no load balancer, and no
online/offline schema pattern. Migrations run *before* the new code serves, so
requests are not served against a half-migrated schema; that is the only
uptime guarantee claimed. If true zero-downtime is required, the deployment
must grow a second host, a load balancer and an expand/contract migration
cadence — out of scope for this step and stated here rather than pretended.

## 5. Migrations and rollback

`scripts/migrate.py` is the **only** sanctioned way the API applies migrations
in staging/production. It acquires a session-level PostgreSQL advisory lock
(`pg_try_advisory_lock`, key `7272_0011`) and then runs
`alembic upgrade head` in a subprocess. Concurrent container starts serialize
on the lock instead of racing DDL. If the lock is not acquired within
`MIGRATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 600 s) it fails loudly. Startup never
silently skips migrations: the entrypoint runs `migrate.py` and exits on
failure, so the container never serves with a stale schema.

Migration chain (`alembic/versions/`): a single linear head at
`0024_qa_conversation_intelligence` with no gaps back to `0001_baseline`
(enforced by `tests/test_deployment.py`). `0018` adds membership, invitation
and quota tables and backfills one active membership per existing user without
rewriting user or tenant ids. `0017` adds `organizations`,
`environments`, and a non-null `tenants.organization_id` after backfilling one
organization and one production environment per existing tenant. It does not
add `environment_id` to calls, leads, billing or identity. `0019` adds that column to calls, leads, appointments, knowledge documents and chunks, automations and runs, notifications, inbox thread state, and usage events, then backfills each tenant's active production environment. It does not add the column to billing, SSO, API keys, or service accounts. `0020` adds the durable job, delivery, webhook and email tables and extends inbox thread state with a version and SLA clock. It reuses the existing automation, notification and inbox tables and does not copy a row onto another tenant. `0021` adds tenant-scoped AI prompt versions, model policy, evaluation datasets and an admission counter. It does not store provider API keys and does not copy billing usage events. `0022` adds phone-number inventory, recording metadata, consent, transcript jobs, callback idempotency and QoS samples. It does not store provider credentials and does not copy the Call table. `0023` adds contact-center queues, skills, presence and routing decisions. It does not copy Call, User, Tenant or the inbox assignee. `0024` adds QA scorecards, reviews, evidence references, compliance, coaching, calibration, sampling and auto-review runs. It does not copy Call, Turn or recordings. Revision `0012` adds the five tables
behind the automation/notification/inbox surface (`automations`,
`automation_runs`, `notification_templates`, `notifications`,
`inbox_thread_states`); before it those services kept their state in process
memory, so a restart lost automations, notifications and unread badges. `alembic.ini`/`env.py` use the
SQLAlchemy URL from settings.

**Rollback policy:**

* `scripts/rollback.sh <git-sha>` checks out the sha and runs
  `deploy.sh --no-pull`. It records the *applied* migration revision first, so
  the operator can see whether the target sha predates the schema.
* **It never runs `alembic downgrade`.** Forward migrations can be destructive
  in principle (a `downgrade` can drop columns and lose data). Downgrades are
  a separate, explicitly-authorized, operator-run action.
* Migrations are written **additive/backward-compatible wherever practical**,
  so an old app against a newer schema keeps working — code rollback then
  needs no schema rollback. When a change cannot be backward-compatible it is
  released as its own step and documented as "no code rollback past this point
  without a manual downgrade".

## 6. Backup and restore

**Schedule/format/retention:** the `backup` service (and `scripts/backup.sh`)
take a nightly `pg_dump` custom-format (`-Fc`) archive; the last 14 are kept
locally; optional `rclone` sync to an S3-compatible remote when `RCLONE_REMOTE`
is set. **Off-site is required, not optional**: backups must not live only in
the same failure domain as the primary database — keep `RCLONE_REMOTE` (or an
equivalent) pointed somewhere outside the primary VM.

**Verification:** every dump — nightly, pre-deploy, or manual — is verified
with `pg_restore --list` before it is retained or synced; an unreadable dump
is reported and never counted as a backup (`backup_verify.sh` does this
standalone). `backup.sh` exits non-zero on an unreadable dump.

**Restore (`scripts/restore.sh`):**

1. verifies the dump with `pg_restore --list` **before writing anything**
2. refuses to restore over a database that already has tables unless
   `RESTORE_ALLOW_OVERWRITE=1` — a drill can never silently clobber a live DB
3. `RESTORE_TARGET_DB=voxdesk_restore_drill` restores into a **scratch**
   database for safe, non-production drills
4. after restoring, re-counts tables and fails if nothing landed

Post-restore verification (operator checklist): confirm the Alembic revision
(`alembic current`), spot-check tenant rows, billing/subscription rows, call
records and audit rows, then run `/health/ready` and `scripts/smoke_test.py`.
A restore that has not actually been exercised is not trusted.

## 7. Redis recovery classification

Redis is **ephemeral / cache-only** in this architecture: it holds the
per-IP rate-limit counters and the cache. The compose stack gives it an AOF
volume (`redisdata`) for convenient restart, but no correctness-critical state
lives in Redis — call state, tenant data, billing and audit all live in
PostgreSQL. The application already treats Redis as best-effort: on any Redis
error, reads return cache-miss, writes are dropped, and `ping()` reports
unreachable (`app/core/cache.py`). **Recovery is therefore "wipe and restart"**
— a lost cache is repopulated on demand and rate-limit counters reset, which
is an acceptable, documented behavior (not a data-loss event). This is pinned
by `tests/test_deployment.py::test_redis_cache_degrades_gracefully_when_down`.

## 8. TLS / reverse proxy

Caddy is the public entry point (80/443; automatic Let's Encrypt when `DOMAIN`
is set). `Caddyfile`:

* `admin off` — the admin control plane is not exposed
* security headers at the proxy layer (HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`), mirrored by the app middleware
* `request_body max_size 25MB` — above the 20 MB knowledge-upload ceiling
* **WebSocket upgrade passes through unchanged** — the Twilio Media Streams
  handshake depends on it, and nothing in the file interferes
* Grafana is only exposed when `GRAFANA_DOMAIN` is explicitly set; otherwise
  it is reachable only inside the compose network

The API trusts `X-Forwarded-*` via `--proxy-headers` (entrypoint) so
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `wss://` and Twilio signature validation work; tighten
`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` from the default `*` in hardened setups.

## 9. Monitoring exposure

Prometheus and Grafana are **internal**. Prometheus has no host ports at all;
Grafana binds `127.0.0.1:3000` and is only proxied when `GRAFANA_DOMAIN` is
set. The API `/metrics` scrape endpoint is gated by `METRICS_TOKEN` when set
(`app/core/metrics.py::_scrape_authorized`). The Caddyfile contains no
`/metrics` route. `tests/test_deployment.py` pins all of these.

## 10. Secrets and supply chain

* No secrets in Git: `.gitignore` covers `.env`, `secrets/`, `backups/`,
  `*.dump`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `.netrc`; gitleaks runs in CI; `.env.example`
  and `.env.staging.example` contain placeholders only (asserted by tests).
* No secrets in the image or build context: `.dockerignore` excludes the same
  set, and the Dockerfile never copies `.env`.
* No secrets in logs/errors: Sentry DSN is the only observability secret and
  is never logged or returned by the API (existing behavior, unchanged).
* **Dockerfile**: multi-stage, runs as non-root `appuser` (UID 10001),
  `HEALTHCHECK`, pinned base `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` (see the comment in
  the file — the pin is a deliberate change policy, not a blind upgrade), no
  build tooling in the runtime stage.
* **Dependency/image scanning**: CI runs `bandit` (SAST), `pip-audit`
  (Python dependency CVEs), `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`
  (shipped frontend dependencies) and gitleaks; compose images are pinned
  (`postgres:16-alpine`, `redis:7-alpine`, `prom/prometheus:v2.53.0`,
  `grafana/grafana:11.1.0`, `caddy:2.9-alpine`).

### Accepted risks (documented, not hidden)

* `npm audit` (full, including dev) reports a **moderate** advisory in the
  Vitest *test tooling* (`@vitest/mocker` redirect mock, fixed only by a
  breaking Vitest major). It does not affect shipped code: `npm audit
  --omit=dev` is clean. Mitigation: upgrade Vitest on its next major in a
  dedicated change; do not `--force` a breaking upgrade mid-step.
* `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` defaults to `*` for single-proxy deployments; document
  and tighten when a second proxy is introduced.

## 11. CI/CD and deploy authorization

* Normal CI (every push/PR): backend lint + tests, Postgres migration round
  trip (`alembic upgrade head` + `downgrade base`), frontend tests + build +
  production audit, Docker image build.
* **Real-provider tests are separate and manual** (`real-integrations.yml`,
  `workflow_dispatch`, gated on `VOXDESK_REAL_INTEGRATION=1` and the
  `real_provider` marker). They are never in the default CI path.
* **Production deployment requires explicit authorization**: there is no
  automatic deploy-to-prod step. Deploys are operator-run via
  `scripts/deploy.sh`; the safe defaults (backup + verified migration +
  readiness wait) are the authorization gate.

## 12. Staging smoke test

`scripts/smoke_test.py` is the deterministic, read-only deployment smoke test:
it exercises `/health`, `/health/ready`, the dashboard shell, `/metrics`
(200/401/404 are all legitimate), `/auth/login` (a bogus login must 4xx,
never 500), `/api/tenants` (anonymous must be refused), the Twilio webhook
(unsigned POST must 403 — proving signature verification is fail-closed), the
provider-config presence and the E2E guard state. It performs **no** writes
and **no** external calls; non-zero exit gates the deploy.

```bash
SMOKE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001 python scripts/smoke_test.py   # staging
```
