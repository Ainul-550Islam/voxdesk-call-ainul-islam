"""
Grounded prompting and prompt-injection defence.

Two things are under test. First, that retrieved evidence reaches the model
framed as untrusted data with an explicit "don't invent facts" instruction.
Second, that a document trying to talk to the model is defanged.

An honest note on scope: no known technique makes an LLM perfectly immune to
prompt injection. What is testable -- and what is tested here -- is that our
layers do their jobs: instructions are neutralised before rendering, fences
cannot be forged, and the real backstop (tenant-scoped retrieval, and no tool
firing because a document said so) does not depend on the model's judgement
at all.
