STEP 8 phase 2: the agent configuration read endpoint.

`PATCH /api/tenants/{id}/voice` has existed since v0.5, but nothing could read
the configuration back. These cover the new `GET /api/tenants/{id}/agent`:
that it is tenant-scoped, that every role may read it, and above all that it
never serialises a credential.
