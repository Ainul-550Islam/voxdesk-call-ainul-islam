"""
Human transfer orchestration.

This is the module that makes `escalate_to_human` mean something. Before it,
the tool set `call.escalated = True`, returned `{"action": "transfer"}` and
told the caller "let me put you through" -- and nothing else happened. The
comment in `functions.py` claimed the pipeline watched for `action ==
"transfer"`; it did not. `transfer.execute_transfer` had no callers at all.

The rule this module exists to enforce:

    A transfer is only "transferred" once the provider has accepted the
    redirect. The AI asking for a transfer is a *request*, not an outcome.

So the flow is deliberately two-phase:

    REQUESTED  -- intent recorded, destination validated, nothing dialled yet
    DIALING    -- provider accepted the redirect; the human's phone is ringing
    CONNECTED  -- the human answered (proved by a provider callback)
    FAILED     -- validation, provider, or the human not picking up

`CallStatus.TRANSFERRED` is only set at DIALING, i.e. after the provider has
actually taken the instruction. It is never set from REQUESTED.

Idempotency is enforced by `Call.transfer_state`. Any second request while a
transfer is in flight returns the existing state instead of placing another
call to the human. That matters: LLMs retry tool calls, and a duplicate here
means a real second phone ringing on somebody's desk.
