"""
Normalized CRM errors.

Every provider fails differently. GoHighLevel returns 422 with a JSON body,
HubSpot returns 400 with a `category` field, Jobber is GraphQL and answers 200
with an `errors` array, and a generic webhook returns whatever the tenant's
server felt like. Retry logic must not have to know any of that.

So each adapter's only job on failure is to raise one of these. The retry
policy then reads exactly one property — `retryable` — and never inspects a
status code or a provider message.

The important distinction is **transient versus permanent**, and getting it
wrong is expensive in both directions:

* Treating a permanent error as transient means five pointless requests, an
  angry rate limiter, and a sync that reports FAILED for twenty minutes before
  admitting it was never going to work.
* Treating a transient error as permanent means a lead silently lost because
  the provider had a bad thirty seconds.

`safe_message()` exists because these strings are shown to tenants and written
to the database. A provider's raw response body is exactly the sort of thing
that echoes a submitted token back at you, so nothing raw ever gets stored.
