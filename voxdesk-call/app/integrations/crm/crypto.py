"""
Application-level encryption for CRM credentials at rest.

Threat model, stated plainly, because "encrypted" is meaningless without one:

* **Defends against** a database dump. A stolen backup, a misconfigured
  read replica, a support engineer with SELECT, an ORM logger printing rows
  — none of those yield a usable provider token.
* **Does not defend against** an attacker who already runs the application
  process. They have the key, by construction. Nothing short of an HSM or a
  remote KMS changes that, and neither is in scope for this step.

The design is deliberately boring:

* **AES-256-GCM.** Authenticated, so a tampered ciphertext fails to decrypt
  rather than silently producing garbage that then gets sent to a provider.
* **A random 96-bit nonce per encryption.** Never derived, never reused.
* **Key ids in the envelope.** Every ciphertext records which key produced
  it, so a key can be rotated by adding the new one and leaving the old one
  readable, rather than by a synchronised flag day.
* **AAD binds the ciphertext to its owner.** The tenant id and provider are
  authenticated-but-not-encrypted, so a row copied from Tenant A's
  integration into Tenant B's will not decrypt. Moving ciphertext between
  rows is a real attack against naive column encryption; this closes it.

There is no home-grown cipher and no fallback that quietly stores plaintext.
If the key is not configured the application refuses to encrypt, and
`Settings.validate_security()` refuses to boot production.
