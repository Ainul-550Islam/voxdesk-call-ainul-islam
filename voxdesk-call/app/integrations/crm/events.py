"""
Normalized events and idempotency.

The central rule of this step: **a business fact is recorded once, delivery is
attempted many times.** The old code conflated the two — `call.crm_synced` was
set before the POST, so a crash in between lost the event permanently while
still claiming it was sent.

Here, `emit()` writes a `CrmEvent` and a `CrmSync` row per enabled
integration, inside the caller's transaction. Nothing is sent. A worker picks
the syncs up afterwards. If the process dies immediately after the commit, the
event survives and is delivered late; if it dies before, the business fact was
never committed either, so there is nothing to lose.

**Idempotency keys are derived, not generated.** A random uuid per emit would
make every duplicate call a new event, which is exactly the failure mode
requirement 12 lists: duplicate webhooks, worker restarts, and API timeouts
after the provider already accepted. The key is a pure function of the
business fact, so the same fact computes the same key forever, and the unique
constraint on `(tenant_id, idempotency_key)` turns a duplicate emit into a
no-op at the database level rather than a race in Python.
