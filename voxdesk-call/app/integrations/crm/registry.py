"""
Provider registry.

One dict, and a rule enforced by a contract test: every member of
`CrmProviderType` has an entry, and every entry's `name` equals the enum
value. Adding Salesforce is a class plus a line here.

The registry deliberately maps to *classes*, not instances. An adapter holds
a `ProviderContext` containing one tenant's decrypted credentials, so a
process-wide instance would be a cross-tenant credential leak waiting for a
concurrency bug. `build()` constructs a fresh adapter per operation and it is
discarded afterwards.
