"""
Retry policy and per-tenant rate protection.

Two separate concerns that both answer the question "should this request go
out right now", kept in one module because they are always consulted together.

**Retry** (requirement 13). Bounded, exponential, jittered. The jitter is not
decoration: without it, a provider outage that fails a hundred syncs at once
produces a hundred retries at exactly t+2s, then t+6s, then t+14s. Every
retry wave lands simultaneously and re-creates the overload that caused the
failure. Full jitter spreads them.

**Rate protection** (requirement 23). A token bucket per (tenant, provider).
The provider's own 429 tells us we already went too fast; this stops us
getting there. Its real purpose is the one the brief names: one tenant whose
credentials are broken, or whose provider is throttling them, must not consume
the shared worker's every pass while other tenants' events queue behind.
