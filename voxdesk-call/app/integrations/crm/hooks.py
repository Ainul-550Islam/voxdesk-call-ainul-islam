"""
Where VoxDesk business events become CRM events.

One module, imported by the telephony and agent layers, so that "which
lifecycle moments reach a CRM" is a question with a single answer rather than
seven `emit()` calls scattered across the codebase.

Every function here obeys the same three rules:

* **It never raises.** Requirement 28: a CRM problem is a backend integration
  problem and the caller — a live phone call — must not hear about it or be
  delayed by it.
* **It never sends anything.** It writes rows. The worker sends. That is what
  makes a crash between "the call ended" and "the CRM knows" recoverable.
* **It does not commit.** The caller owns the transaction, so the event and
  the business change it describes land together.
