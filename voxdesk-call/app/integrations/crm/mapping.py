"""
Field mapping and custom-field configuration.

Two jobs, both of which requirement 16 and 17 ask for and the old code did
inside `crm.py` where every provider could see every other provider's shape.

**Building the normalized contact.** `contact_from_call`, `contact_from_lead`
and friends turn VoxDesk rows into `NormalizedContact`. This is the only place
that knows a `Call` has `from_number` on inbound and `to_number` on outbound.
Adapters never see a `Call`.

**Validating tenant custom-field configuration.** A tenant can map VoxDesk
values into their own provider fields. Requirement 17 is explicit that this
must not become "arbitrary unbounded JSON becomes a provider payload", and
that is not paranoia: the mapping is tenant-supplied, it is stored as JSON,
and it ends up serialized into an outbound HTTPS request against credentials
the tenant owns. Unbounded means a tenant can post a ten-megabyte body to
HubSpot on our worker's time.

So the config is validated on write, against an allowlist of source values,
with bounds on key length, value length and count.
