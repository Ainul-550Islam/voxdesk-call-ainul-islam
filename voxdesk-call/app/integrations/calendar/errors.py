"""
Normalized calendar errors.

Same discipline as `app/integrations/crm/errors.py`, and deliberately the same
shape: business logic reads one property, `retryable`, and never inspects a
status code or a vendor exception name.

The distinction that costs money here is different from the CRM one. A CRM
sync failing is invisible to the customer and can be retried for twenty
minutes. A *booking* failing is happening while someone is on the phone, so
the layer must decide in seconds and must never resolve ambiguity by guessing.
`CalendarConflictError` in particular is a first-class outcome rather than an
error condition: it means another booking won the slot, which is normal.
