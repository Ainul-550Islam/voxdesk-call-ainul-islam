"""
Timezone handling for scheduling.

The rule this module enforces, everywhere, without exception:

    **Store UTC. Reason in the tenant's zone. Never let the two blur.**

A voice agent is unusually exposed to timezone bugs. "Tomorrow at three"
carries no offset, arrives at a server whose clock is UTC, and refers to a
business that might be in Los Angeles. Get it wrong by an hour twice a year and
the customer arrives to a locked door — and the failure is invisible in
testing, because it only reproduces on two Sundays.

The three cases that actually break, and what this module does about them:

**DST is not a fixed offset.** `America/New_York` is −05:00 in January and
−04:00 in July. Adding `timedelta(days=1)` to an aware datetime adds exactly
24 hours of *elapsed time*, which across a spring-forward boundary lands on a
different wall-clock hour than the caller said. So date arithmetic is done on
naive wall-clock values and localised afterwards — never the other way round.

**Ambiguous times.** When clocks go back, 01:30 happens twice. `zoneinfo`
resolves this with `fold`: `fold=0` is the first (DST) occurrence, `fold=1` the
second (standard). Defaulting silently would put an appointment an hour off
half the time, so `resolve_local()` reports the ambiguity and the caller
decides.

**Nonexistent times.** When clocks go forward, 02:30 never happens.
`zoneinfo` does not raise — it happily produces a datetime whose UTC round trip
lands somewhere else entirely. That silent wrongness is worse than an error, so
this module detects it by round-tripping and reports it.
