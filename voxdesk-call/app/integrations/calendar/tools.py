"""
Voice-agent scheduling tools.

Requirement 15's core clause: *"Do NOT let the LLM invent booking success. The
tool result must be the source of truth."*

Three mechanisms enforce that, and they are structural rather than
instructional — a system prompt asking the model not to lie is not a control:

1. **The outcome vocabulary is a closed enum.** `BookingOutcome` has fourteen
   members and the tool payload can only ever carry one of them. There is no
   value the model can receive that means "booked" unless the service wrote it
   after a provider acknowledgement.
2. **The message text is written here, not by the model.** Every result
   carries a `message` composed by the service. The prompt tells the agent to
   read it.
3. **Provider detail never reaches the payload.** `as_tool_payload()` is an
   allowlist: outcome, message, appointment id, slots. No provider name, no
   status code, no error string. The caller cannot be told "Google returned
   401" because the model never learns it.

Every tool is also bounded by `calendar_voice_timeout_seconds`. Requirement 30
says an availability lookup must not hang; on a phone call, three seconds of
silence is already a problem, so the tool returns a safe fallback rather than
waiting for a provider that has stopped answering.
