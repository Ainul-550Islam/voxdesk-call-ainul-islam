"""
Providers backed by what the repository already had.

Two adapters, and the split between them is the point.

**`InternalCalendarProvider`** — no external calendar at all. VoxDesk's own
`appointments` table is the entire source of truth. This is the correct default
for a small business that has not connected anything, and it is what makes the
booking flow work end to end without a vendor account. It declares every
capability *except* free/busy, because there is no third-party calendar to be
busy on: the service already checks VoxDesk's own appointments separately, and
declaring `FREE_BUSY` here would double-count them.

**`GoogleServiceAccountProvider`** — the pre-STEP-6 path, wrapping
`app/integrations/google_calendar.CalendarClient` unchanged.

That wrapper declares only `FREE_BUSY` and `CREATE_EVENT`, because those are
the only two methods the legacy client has. It cannot cancel, cannot
reschedule, and cannot read an event back. Declaring more would let the service
route work to methods that do not exist.

It also carries a limitation that cannot be fixed from the outside: the legacy
client catches every exception and returns `[]` or `None`, so this adapter
genuinely cannot tell an outage from an empty calendar. That is the audit's F2,
and the honest response is to surface it rather than paper over it — hence
`create_event` raising when the legacy call returns `None`, and `get_busy`
being documented as unable to distinguish the two cases. Tenants should be
migrated to per-tenant OAuth (`CalendarProviderType.GOOGLE`), which does not
have this problem.
