"""
Natural date and time interpretation.

Requirement 16, and specifically its last line: *"Do not trust the model for
DST/timezone mathematics. Use deterministic date/time libraries."*

The design follows from that. The LLM's job is to pass through what the caller
said — `"next Tuesday"`, `"at three"` — and this module resolves it against the
business's calendar using `zoneinfo`. The model never computes a date, never
applies an offset, and never decides what "tomorrow" means.

Three rules:

**Everything is relative to the business's local now**, not the server's.
"Tomorrow" at 23:00 in Dhaka is a different date than "tomorrow" at 13:00 UTC.

**Ambiguity produces a question, not a guess.** If a caller says "Tuesday" and
today is Tuesday, that is two plausible dates. If they say "at three" with no
meridiem and the business is open at 3 AM and 3 PM, that is two plausible
times. Both return `Ambiguity` and the agent asks — because a silently-picked
time is a missed appointment nobody notices until the customer does not arrive.

**Parsing failure is not a fallback to today.** An unrecognised phrase returns
`None`. The alternative — defaulting — is how "sometime next month" becomes an
appointment this afternoon.
