"""
The appointment service.

The one place that holds a tenant's calendar integration, its scheduling
policy, a provider adapter and the database at the same time. Routes and voice
tools call this; nothing calls a provider SDK directly.

Four rules shape every function here, and each one exists because the audit
found the opposite:

**Never claim a booking the provider did not accept.** `_confirm` is the only
path that writes `CONFIRMED`, and it requires an `external_event_id`. A
provider returning 200 with no id is a failure to record, not a success. The
pre-STEP-6 code wrote the row and said "Booked" regardless.

**An unreachable calendar is not an empty calendar.** `get_busy` raises; this
layer catches it and either refuses to book (default) or degrades explicitly,
never silently.

**The slot lock is in the database, not in application logic.** Two callers
racing compute the same `slot_key`; the unique constraint decides. No amount
of interleaving can produce two confirmed bookings for one slot.

**An ambiguous timeout is reconciled, never blind-retried.** If a provider
call times out we ask the provider whether the event exists before doing
anything else. "I could not check" is treated as unknown, not as absence.
