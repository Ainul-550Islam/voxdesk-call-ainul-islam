"""
The calendar provider interface.

Same shape as the CRM layer's `base.py`, deliberately: one codebase, one way
of writing an adapter. Capability is *declared*, not discovered by calling and
failing, so the service can ask "can this provider reschedule?" before it tries.

Two things every adapter gets and must use:

* `request()` — the single HTTP entry point. It applies the timeout, converts
  every transport failure into the normalized taxonomy, reads `Retry-After`,
  and lets no `httpx` exception escape. An adapter making a raw call bypasses
  retry classification, so there is a contract test for it.
* `CalendarContext` — everything the adapter is allowed to know. No database
  session, no `Tenant` row. An adapter *cannot* reach another tenant because
  it holds nothing capable of it.
