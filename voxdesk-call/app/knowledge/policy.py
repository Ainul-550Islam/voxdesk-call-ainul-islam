When to retrieve.

Retrieval is not free: an embedding call plus a vector search inside a 1.5
second budget, on every turn, while a caller waits. Most turns of a phone call
do not need it -- "yeah", "okay", "Tuesday works", "my name is Sarah" carry no
question about the business.

So there is an explicit, testable policy rather than an implicit one. It is
intentionally cheap and conservative: a keyword-and-shape heuristic, no model
call, and it errs toward retrieving. A wasted lookup costs a few milliseconds;
a skipped lookup costs a wrong answer.

The agent's own tool call remains the primary signal. This gate exists for the
paths that consider retrieving without one, and to keep the "should we?"
decision in one reviewable place.
