"""
Vector storage and similarity search.

Two backends, one interface:

* **pgvector** -- used when PostgreSQL has the extension. The nearest-neighbour
  ordering happens in the database with an ivfflat/hnsw index.
* **JSON scan** -- the portable fallback. Vectors live in a JSON column and
  cosine similarity is computed in Python over the candidate rows.

The fallback is not a toy: it is what makes the whole system testable on
SQLite, and for the few thousand chunks a small business actually uploads it
is fast enough to serve production. It degrades linearly, which is why the
pgvector path exists.

**The rule this module exists to enforce:** the tenant filter is part of the
SQL WHERE clause, always. Not a Python filter over the results, not a check on
the way out. A retrieval query that somehow lost its tenant predicate must
return zero rows, not another business's price list. Every query in this file
is built through `_base_query`, which cannot be constructed without a tenant.
