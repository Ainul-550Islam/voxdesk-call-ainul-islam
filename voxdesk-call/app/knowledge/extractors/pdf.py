"""
PDF extraction, page by page.

pypdf is pure Python and does not shell out, which matters: a PDF is an
untrusted file and handing it to a native converter is a much larger attack
surface than reading it in-process.

Page numbers are preserved because "where did that come from?" is the first
question anyone asks about a RAG answer.
