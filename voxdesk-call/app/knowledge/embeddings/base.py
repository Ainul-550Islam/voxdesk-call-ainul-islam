"""
Embedding provider interface.

Retrieval code must never name a provider. It asks for `get_embedder()` and
receives something with a model id, a dimension count, and the ability to
embed a list of strings. Swapping OpenAI for a local model is a config change,
not a code change.

The other job of this module is version safety. A vector produced by
`openai:text-embedding-3-small` is meaningless to `hashing-v1`, and mixing
them silently produces a search that returns plausible-looking garbage. So
every provider exposes an `identity` string that is stored next to each vector
and compared before that vector is ever used.
