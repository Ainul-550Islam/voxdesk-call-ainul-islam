"""
A deterministic, dependency-free embedder for development and tests.

This is a hashed bag-of-words projection (the "hashing trick"): word and
bigram features are hashed into a fixed number of buckets, weighted by a
sublinear term frequency, and L2-normalized. Cosine similarity between two
such vectors is a real lexical-overlap measure, so retrieval tests can assert
that a relevant chunk outranks an irrelevant one without any network call, any
API key, or any nondeterminism.

What it is not: semantic. It cannot match "how much does it cost" to "our
pricing is". That is precisely why `validate_security()` refuses to boot
production with this provider selected -- it is honest infrastructure for
tests, and a bad answer engine for customers.

#: Words carrying no retrieval signal.

#: This list started out deliberately small, on the theory that an aggressive
#: stop list hurts short queries like "are you open". Measurement said
#: otherwise: with function words left in, "what is your return policy on
#: tractors" matched the insurance section on nothing but "your" and "not",
#: scoring above genuinely relevant chunks for other questions. Generic words
#: appear in every chunk, so they contribute similarity without contributing
#: meaning -- the lexical equivalent of a document with no IDF weighting.
#:
#: Content words carry the query instead. "how much does a cleaning cost"
#: reduces to "clean cost", which is exactly the signal that should match.
