"""
Ingestion job dispatch.

There is no Celery here, and that is a decision rather than an omission. The
project already has a worker pattern -- `scripts/scheduler.py`, a plain
asyncio process with polling loops -- and introducing a broker, a result
backend and a second deployment unit to index a few PDFs would be
infrastructure the product does not need.

So this is a small abstraction with two implementations:

* **inline** (default, and correct for development): the work runs in a
  FastAPI `BackgroundTask` after the response is sent. The HTTP request is not
  blocked, and there is nothing extra to deploy.
* **worker**: the upload only writes the row; `scripts/scheduler.py` polls for
  UPLOADED documents and processes them. This is what production runs, because
  an app process restarting mid-ingestion should not lose the job.

Both paths call the same `process_document()`, so behaviour cannot diverge.
Choosing between them is `settings.knowledge_ingest_mode`.

Safety properties in both modes:

* Each job opens its **own** database session. Reusing the request's session
  in a background task is a use-after-close bug waiting to happen, and the
  request's transaction is already committed by then anyway.
* Jobs are idempotent. A document processed twice ends in the same state with
  the same chunks -- see the delete-then-insert in `ingest.process_document`.
* A job never raises into its caller. A failure becomes a FAILED document.
