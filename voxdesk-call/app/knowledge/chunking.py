"""
Deterministic, section-aware chunking.

Design points that matter for retrieval quality:

* Chunks are built *within* a section (a PDF page, a markdown heading, a block
  of CSV rows), never across two of them. A chunk therefore always has one
  honest answer to "where is this from?", and a heading never gets welded onto
  unrelated text from the next page.
* A heading is never left stranded at the end of a chunk. If a split would
  land just after a heading line, the split point moves back so the heading
  travels with the text it introduces.
* Splits prefer paragraph breaks, then sentence ends, then whitespace. Cutting
  mid-word produces a token sequence that exists in no real document and
  embeds poorly.
* The function is pure: same text plus same settings gives byte-identical
  chunks, every time. Reindexing a document that has not changed must produce
  the same rows, which is what makes retries idempotent.

Sizes are in characters, not tokens. Tokenization is provider-specific, and a
character budget with a 4:1 estimate keeps chunking independent of whichever
embedding model is configured. The default 3200 characters is roughly 800
tokens, comfortably inside every provider's input window.
