"""
The retrieval entry point.

Everything above this layer -- the voice agent, the text agent, the evaluation
suite -- calls `retrieve()` and gets back plain result objects. Nothing above
this layer knows what an embedding is, which provider is configured, or how
the vector store works.

Two guarantees this module makes:

1. **A tenant is mandatory.** There is no "search everything" mode, not even
   for an admin. The signature cannot express one.
2. **A result carries no internal machinery.** Scores and vectors stay on the
   internal object; `to_source()` produces the trimmed dict that is safe to
   log, return over the API, or hand to prompt construction.
