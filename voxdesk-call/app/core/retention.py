"""Data retention enforcement (Step 9 compliance).

Deletes call records and their transcripts (Turn rows) older than the
configured retention window. Call records and transcripts hold personal and
health-adjacent data, so a documented, configurable retention policy with a
working deletion path is a hard requirement for GDPR/EU AI Act posture and for
healthcare buyers.

Recording / object-storage boundary
-----------------------------------
VoxDesk does not copy recording media into its own storage. `Call.recording_url`
is an optional pointer to provider-hosted media (Twilio) and is never populated
by the current pipeline, so there is no VoxDesk-side object to expunge here.
When an object-storage recording backend is added, its deletion MUST be wired
into this same purge (next to the Turn/Call deletes below) so recordings never
outlive the policy. Deleting media that lives in a provider account is a
provider-account operation, not VoxDesk storage.

Deliberate scope decisions:

* Audit logs are NOT deleted -- SOC 2 requires the audit trail to outlive the
  operational data it describes.
* Deletion is bounded per run (``limit``) so a first run against a large table
  does not stall the scheduler; the next tick resumes where it left off.
* The scheduler calls this once a day (``RETENTION_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` in
  scripts/scheduler.py).

Pure policy helpers (cutoff/is_expired) live in app/core/data_policy.py so they
are importable without touching the database.
