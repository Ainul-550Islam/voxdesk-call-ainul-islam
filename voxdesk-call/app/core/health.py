"""Readiness probe internals (Step 7 observability).

Liveness vs readiness
---------------------
* **Liveness** (``/health``) answers "is this process up?". It performs no
  dependency checks at all, so a lost database or Redis never makes a node
  look dead — the orchestrator must not restart a healthy process because a
  dependency blipped.
* **Readiness** (``/health/ready``) answers "can this process serve traffic
  now?". It fails (503) when a *required* dependency is down, so a load
  balancer stops routing to a node that cannot complete requests.

The rules that keep readiness honest and cheap:

* **No provider API call per request.** The provider check verifies only that
  the required *credentials are configured* — a local, free read of settings.
  Live provider reachability is a periodic/event-driven concern (the CRM
  health check, call-time fail-fast), never a per-probe network round trip.
* **Redis is required only when configured.** ``REDIS_URL`` unset means the
  in-process cache is in use and there is nothing to probe.
* **Missing voice providers fail readiness only in production.** A dev/test
  box intentionally runs without live keys; failing its readiness would make
  local tooling and CI pointlessly red. Production fails, loudly, because a
  deployment that cannot answer voice traffic must not accept it.

The probe mutates the ``voxdesk_db_up`` / ``voxdesk_redis_up`` gauges so the
Prometheus side of the same signal stays current between scrapes.
