A2P 10DLC registration + messaging compliance.

In the US, an unregistered business sending SMS over a 10-digit long code gets
its messages filtered by the carriers -- silently. Clients blame you, not the
carrier. Every serious voice/SMS gig has to handle this, which is why the top
Fiverr agencies list "A2P 10DLC" as a selling point.

This module does two things:
  1. Drives Twilio Trust Hub registration (Brand -> Campaign -> number pool).
  2. Enforces the content rules that get campaigns rejected, *before* sending.

Note: registration is part paperwork, part API. The API half lives here; the
paperwork half (EIN, business address, opt-in screenshot) is the client's, and
`registration_checklist()` is what you send them so it is not your bottleneck.
