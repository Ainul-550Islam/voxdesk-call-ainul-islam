"""
Outbound calling: cold-call campaigns, follow-ups and appointment reminders.

This is the half of the product the inbound receptionist does not cover, and
the half most Fiverr gigs charge extra for ("AI Cold Calling Agent",
"Lead Qualification & Follow-Up Agent", "Appointment Reminders").

Compliance is not optional here. US TCPA rules restrict *when* you may call and
require you to honour do-not-call. `is_call_window_open()` and the DNC check in
`next_callable_leads()` are the guardrails -- do not bypass them to hit a quota.
