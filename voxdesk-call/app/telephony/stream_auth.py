"""
Signed stream tokens for the Twilio Media Stream WebSocket.

The WebSocket at /telephony/ws is machine-to-machine: Twilio connects to it,
not a browser, so forcing a user JWT on it would break real calls. But it was
previously authenticated by nothing at all -- any client that guessed or
observed a `callSid` could connect and receive live call audio.

Twilio cannot sign a WebSocket upgrade the way it signs HTTP webhooks (there
is no X-Twilio-Signature on the upgrade request), so the accepted pattern is
to put a short-lived, server-minted token in the stream URL. We generate the
URL ourselves inside <Connect><Stream>, so only whoever already received our
TwiML can hold a valid token.

This is deliberately separate from `app/auth/jwt.py`: different audience,
different lifetime, and it must never be interchangeable with a user token.
