"""
TwiML generation for a warm transfer.

Twilio's live-call-update API rewrites the TwiML of a call that is already in
progress, which hangs up the media stream and dials the human instead.

This module is now the *TwiML builder* only. Orchestration -- validation,
idempotency, state transitions, callbacks -- lives in
`app.telephony.transfer_service`, and the provider call itself lives behind
`app.telephony.provider`. Keeping the three apart is what lets the transfer
logic be tested against a fake provider without mocking the application.

`execute_transfer` below is retained as a thin, low-level escape hatch. It does
NOT update call state; anything user-facing must go through the service.
