"""
The single source of truth for call lifecycle state.

Before this module, call status was written from four different places --
`incoming_call`, `media_stream`'s exception handler, `call_status`, and
`place_call` -- each with its own idea of what was legal. The status webhook in
particular did:

    call.status = _TERMINAL_STATUS.get(CallStatus_, CallStatus.COMPLETED)

which means a duplicate or late Twilio callback would happily rewrite a
TRANSFERRED call as COMPLETED, and an unrecognised status string would silently
be recorded as a successful completion. Twilio retries webhooks, and callbacks
from a parent call and a transfer leg can arrive out of order, so both of those
things happen in production rather than in theory.

Everything here is pure state-machine logic over a `Call` row. There are no
HTTP concerns and no provider SDK imports, so the rules can be tested directly.

Terminology
-----------
*Terminal* states are COMPLETED, FAILED and NO_ANSWER. Once a call reaches one,
nothing may move it anywhere else.

TRANSFERRED is deliberately **not** terminal: a transferred call is still up,
just with a human on it, and it must still be allowed to reach COMPLETED (or
FAILED) when the human hangs up.
