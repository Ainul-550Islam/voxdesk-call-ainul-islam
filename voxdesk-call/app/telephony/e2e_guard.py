"""Real-call E2E safety guard (Step 5, scale-compliance).

The application can already place outbound calls and answer inbound calls for
real tenants. This module is the *only* sanctioned way a genuine, end-to-end
Twilio media-stream call may be exercised on purpose, and it is deliberately
the narrowest possible gate:

* It never places a call, never mutates anything, and never talks to Twilio.
  It only classifies an *incoming* webhook against a strict allowlist.
* It is armed only when ``settings.e2e_enabled`` is true.
* When disarmed, it is a no-op: every inbound call is ordinary traffic and
  the product behaves exactly as before.
* When armed, production traffic is refused outright and the only calls that
  may proceed are explicit, allowlisted, test-tenant calls. Anything else is
  rejected before a `Call` row, session, media stream, or billing event can
  exist.

Error messages are intentionally generic: they never echo the caller's number,
the dialed number, or any configured value, so nothing secret or personally
identifiable leaks into responses or logs.

The operator-run flow (see docs/runbooks/REAL-E2E-RUNBOOK.md) is:

1. Provision a dedicated test tenant and mark it `is_test_tenant=True`.
2. Point that tenant's `twilio_number` at the dedicated test number.
3. Set `E2E_ENABLED=true`, `E2E_TEST_NUMBER=<test number>`,
   `E2E_ALLOWED_CALLERS=<operator phone, ...>` in a non-production
   environment.
4. A human dials the test number from the allowlisted phone and talks.
5. Record the outcome in the structured result record; never automate step 4.
