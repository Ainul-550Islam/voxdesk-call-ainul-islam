"""
Telephony provider abstraction.

The transfer service must be testable against *real application code* -- the
same service, the same session, the same rows -- without dialling anyone. The
only thing that genuinely cannot run in a test is the outbound HTTP call to
Twilio, so that is the only thing behind an interface.

This deliberately does NOT abstract the whole telephony layer. Wrapping
everything would let a test pass while the real integration is broken, which is
the failure mode these tests exist to catch.

`FakeTelephonyProvider` lives here rather than in `tests/` so the fake and the
real client are forced to stay the same shape.
