"""
Phone number normalization and validation.

Before this module the codebase passed raw strings straight to Twilio:
`lead.phone`, `tenant.escalation_number`, `tenant.outbound_caller_id`. A
mistyped escalation number meant the transfer silently dialled nothing, and a
number stored as "(555) 010-1234" in one place and "+15550101234" in another
compared unequal.

Design rules, deliberately conservative:

* We normalize *formatting* only -- spaces, dashes, brackets, dots, a leading
  "00" international prefix, and a leading "+" that is already there.
* We NEVER guess a country code. "5550101234" is not silently turned into
  "+15550101234"; a US default would quietly dial the wrong continent for a
  UK client. Ambiguous input is rejected so the caller sees a clear error.
* `+` followed by 8-15 digits is the E.164 shape. Twilio also accepts a few
  non-E.164 endpoint forms (`client:`, `sip:`), which we pass through
  untouched rather than mangling.

`redact()` exists because full phone numbers are personal data and there is no
reason for them to sit in a log aggregator forever.
