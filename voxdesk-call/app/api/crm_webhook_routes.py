"""
Inbound provider webhooks.

    POST /api/integrations/crm/inbound/{provider}/{routing_token}

Requirement 21 is mostly a list of ways to get this wrong, so each one is
addressed explicitly here.

**"Do NOT accept `tenant_id` from an untrusted webhook body as the sole tenant
selector."** The tenant is identified by a `routing_token` in the *path* — a
high-entropy value we generate per integration and hand to the provider when
the webhook is registered. The body is never consulted for routing. A body
field named `tenant_id` is ignored entirely, and there is a test for that.

Why a path token rather than a header or a body field: the provider is
configuring a URL, and a URL is the one thing every provider's webhook UI can
store. A token in the path is also the only option that works for providers
that send no custom headers.

**The token is not the authentication.** It selects which integration to
verify against; the signature is what proves the request is genuine. Anyone
who learns the token still cannot forge an event. This distinction matters,
because URLs leak — into logs, into browser history, into screenshots in
support tickets.

**Replay.** A `CrmWebhookReceipt` row per (tenant, provider, provider event
id) with a unique constraint. The second delivery of the same event finds the
row and stops. Where a provider sends no event id, the timestamp window is the
only defence available and that is stated rather than pretended around.

**A signature failure returns 401 and nothing else.** No hint about whether
the token matched, whether the integration exists, or which part was wrong.
