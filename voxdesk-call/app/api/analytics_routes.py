"""
Analytics aggregation.

Requirement 13: the browser must not pull thousands of rows to compute a
total. Every figure here is a `SELECT count(...)` or `SELECT sum(...)` with a
`WHERE tenant_id` and a date range, so a tenant with 400,000 calls costs the
same round trip as one with four.

**Every percentage has a stated numerator and denominator**, in code and in
`docs/DASHBOARD.md`. The audit found `booking_rate = booked / all calls`,
which silently counted wrong numbers and hang-ups in the denominator and made
a good operator look bad. The definitions here are deliberate:

    answer_rate    = answered / total
    booking_rate   = booked   / *eligible* calls   (answered, >= 10s)
    transfer_rate  = transferred / answered
    failure_rate   = failed / total

`eligible` is the important one. A call that rang out, or that lasted three
seconds because someone misdialled, was never a booking opportunity. Counting
it punishes the tenant for their own wrong numbers.

**No estimated revenue.** The old `/stats` endpoint returned
`estimated_value_usd = booked * 150`, a constant with no relationship to
anything the tenant sells. It is left in that endpoint so nothing breaks, and
it is not repeated here — a number a buyer will read as money has to come
from money.
