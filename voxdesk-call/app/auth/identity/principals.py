"""Who is calling: the one structure every authenticator returns.

There are four ways to reach this API — a human's JWT, a human's API key, a
service account's credential, and a SCIM bearer — and the request pipeline
downstream must not care which one it was. It cares about three things: whose
tenant this is, which permissions the caller may exercise, and whether the
caller is a person (because some endpoints may only be used by one).

``AuthenticatedPrincipal`` is that answer. It is *not* a stand-in for a user
row: ``actor`` is always a real ``users`` row — for a service account it is the
human who created it, which is what makes the tenant binding and the audit
trail work without inventing a phantom account — and the machine-only facts
live in their own fields. Routes that must refuse machines check
``is_machine``; nothing else needs to know.

Organization and environment are not claims on this principal. A client cannot
present an ``organization_id`` or ``environment_id`` and have it trusted. Those
ids are resolved from the tenant row this principal is already bound to.
