"""SSO: connection management, login orchestration, and JIT provisioning.

The split of work in this package is deliberate. ``oidc.py`` and ``saml.py``
know the protocols -- discovery, signatures, claim payloads -- and nothing about
this product. This module knows this product -- tenants, users, roles, audit,
policies -- and orchestrates the protocol modules. Every decision that depends
on *our* data (is this user disabled? is this tenant active? may this mapping
grant that role? has this assertion been seen?) is made here, in one place a
reviewer can read top to bottom.

The invariants this module enforces, each with a test in
``tests/security/test_sso.py``:

* **A federated login never resurrects a disabled user or a disabled tenant.**
  Identity providers do not know about our ``is_active`` flag, and an IdP that
  keeps asserting a user we deprovisioned must not be able to let them back in.
* **A federated login never crosses tenants.** An assertion is only ever matched
  against users in the connection's tenant; a matching address in another tenant
  is a refusal, not a merge, and it is audited.
* **Linking requires proof.** An existing user is linked by ``(connection,
  subject)`` from a previous login, or by a *verified* email claim when the
  connection explicitly allows linking. An unverified claim never links.
* **OWNER is never granted, changed or revoked by SSO.** The platform owner role
  is not in the assignable set, so a mapping cannot name it; and a user who *is*
  an owner keeps that role through a federated login.
* **A state is single-use and an assertion id is single-use.** Both are enforced
  by a conditional UPDATE and a unique constraint, not by read-then-write.
* **Every attempt is recorded**, failures included, with a reason code and no
  claim values.
