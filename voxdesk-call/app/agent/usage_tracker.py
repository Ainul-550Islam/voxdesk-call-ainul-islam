"""Measured AI-usage tracking for the live voice pipeline (Step 7).

The operator questions "how many AI tokens / how many TTS characters / how
many transcription characters did a call use?" are answered here, from the
**provider-reported** usage pipecat 0.0.55 already emits when
``enable_usage_metrics=True`` (the pipeline sets this), plus the transcription
frames Deepgram sends us.

Honesty rules this module exists to uphold:

* Everything counted is *measured* — the LLM's ``total_tokens``, the TTS
  service's reported character count, the transcript text we actually
  received. Nothing is estimated or synthesised.
* The counters go to Prometheus (``app.core.observability``) with **bounded
  labels**; the model string and per-call totals go to the structured log,
  never into a label.
* Cost is recorded through ``app.billing.cost``, which marks UNKNOWN whenever
  no price is configured — a missing price never becomes a made-up number.
* The tracker is pass-through and cannot fail the call: every observation is
  wrapped so a metrics bug can never drop a frame or crash the pipeline.
