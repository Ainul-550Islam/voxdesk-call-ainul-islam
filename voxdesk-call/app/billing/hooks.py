"""
Where VoxDesk business events become billable usage.

One module, imported by the telephony and messaging layers, so "what gets
billed" has a single answer rather than several `+=` scattered around.

Every function here obeys the same rules, and each exists because the audit
found the opposite:

**It never raises.** A billing problem must not turn a completed call into a
500 or leave a caller listening to silence.

**It never commits.** The caller owns the transaction, so usage lands in the
same commit as the fact that caused it.

**It never calls a provider.** Requirement 37: no Stripe call inside the live
voice loop. Usage is a database row; invoicing is Stripe's job, later,
elsewhere.

**It derives its idempotency key from the call, not the callback.** Ten
duplicate Twilio callbacks produce one usage event, and — the bug the audit
actually found — an ordered sequence of callbacks produces the *right* number
of minutes rather than a smaller one.

    A call reached a terminal state. Bill it, once.

    **The voice-minute billing policy (requirements 12 and 13), stated here
    because this is the only place it is applied:**

    * **Total customer-visible call duration**, not per provider leg. A call
      that was transferred to a human is *one* call from the customer's point
      of view and appears as one line on the invoice. Billing the parent leg
      and the dial leg separately would roughly double the charge for every
      escalated call, and the customer has no way to see why.
    * The idempotency key is `voice_minute:{call_id}`. Derived from the call,
      so every duplicate callback, worker retry and out-of-order webhook maps
      to the same event.
    * Recorded **once, at finalization**, from `call.duration_seconds` — which
      STEP 3's state machine has already settled. The old code billed a
      *delta* against whatever a previous callback had stamped, so the same
      120-second call billed 2.00, 1.00 or 0.50 minutes depending on the order
      Twilio delivered its webhooks. Billing the final absolute duration once
      removes the ordering dependency entirely.
    * Seconds are stored; rounding to whole minutes happens once, on the
      period total, in `metering.compute_overage`.

    Returns True when a new usage event was written. False means it was
    already billed — which is the normal outcome of a retried callback.
