"""
Billing periods.

Requirement 17, and the sentence that drives the whole module: *"Never use
server local time as billing-period authority."*

Three rules:

**A period comes from the subscription, not the calendar.** A tenant who
subscribed on the 15th is billed the 15th to the 15th. Rolling their usage up
by calendar month would split every one of their periods across two buckets
and make the invoice unreconcilable with the usage page.

**Everything is UTC.** The label `2026-03` means "the period that *started* in
March UTC", not "March in the tenant's timezone". Two tenants in different
zones on the same plan get the same label for the same subscription period,
which is what makes cross-tenant reporting possible at all.

**Month arithmetic clamps, it does not overflow.** A subscription anchored on
the 31st has no 31st in February. Stripe clamps to the last day of the month
and so does this — `add_months(Jan 31, 1)` is `Feb 28`, not `Mar 3`. Getting
that wrong moves a customer's renewal date permanently, one month at a time.

DST is a non-issue *because* everything is UTC, and that is the reason for the
choice rather than a happy accident: an anchor stored as a local wall clock
would shift by an hour twice a year and eventually cross a day boundary.
