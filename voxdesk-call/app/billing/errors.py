"""
Normalized billing errors.

Same discipline as the CRM and calendar layers: business logic reads one
property, `retryable`, and never inspects a status code or a vendor exception
name.

What is different here is the cost of getting the transient/permanent split
wrong. A CRM sync retried too eagerly wastes quota. A *billing* write retried
without idempotency creates a second subscription and charges a customer
twice, and the customer finds out before we do. So every retryable error in
this module is only retryable through a path that carries an idempotency key.
