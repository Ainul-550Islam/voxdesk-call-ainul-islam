"""
Usage metering.

The audit found `minutes_used` being used as billing authority while built as
a display counter: a mutable float on a mutable row, with no history, no
period and no idempotency key. This module replaces it with an append-only
event log, and demotes the float to a cache that is kept in sync.

Three properties, each of which the old design lacked:

**Immutable.** Nothing here updates or deletes a `UsageEvent`. A correction is
a new row with a negative quantity. That is requirement 35's "never modify
historical usage quantities destructively", and it is also the only way an
invoice dispute is answerable — the original figure survives next to the
correction.

**Idempotency-keyed, with a database constraint behind it.** The key is
derived from the business fact, never generated per attempt. `UNIQUE
(tenant_id, idempotency_key)` is the guarantee; the pre-insert `SELECT` is an
optimisation that makes the common case cheap.

**Integer quantities in the metric's smallest unit.** Seconds, not minutes.
Summing a few thousand floats produces a total that does not match the sum of
its parts, and an invoice that disagrees with its own line items is a support
ticket that cannot be closed.
