"""
Provider webhook processing.

Requirement 21–23. Three concerns, deliberately separated:

**Verification** happens in the adapter, against the raw bytes, before this
module sees anything. `WebhookEvent` can only be produced by
`verify_webhook`, so an unverified body cannot reach a handler by accident.

**Deduplication** is a `BillingWebhookReceipt` row with a unique constraint on
`(provider, provider_event_id)`. Stripe genuinely re-delivers, and here a
duplicate has financial consequences.

**Ordering** is handled by comparing the event's own `created` timestamp
against what we last applied. Stripe makes no delivery-order guarantee at all:
`customer.subscription.updated` routinely arrives before
`checkout.session.completed`, and a retried old event can land after a newer
one. Every state write goes through `service._apply_remote`, which refuses to
go backwards.
