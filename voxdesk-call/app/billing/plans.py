"""
The plan catalogue and the trust boundary around prices.

The single most important function here is `resolve_price_id`. Requirement 8
forbids a browser submitting an amount, a currency or a Stripe price id; the
client names a **plan code** and an **interval**, and the price comes from the
database. Everything else in this module exists to make that lookup safe:
plans are validated on write, inactive plans are refused, and a plan with no
configured price id fails loudly at startup rather than at checkout.

Seed plans are defined here rather than in a migration. A migration is the
wrong home for business data that changes: repricing should be an operator
action against a running system, not a schema change. `sync_seed_plans()` is
idempotent and never overwrites a price an operator has edited.
