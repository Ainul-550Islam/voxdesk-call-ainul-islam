"""
Usage reconciliation.

Requirement 34. The purpose is not to *fix* anything automatically — it is to
make a discrepancy visible with an audit trail. The last line of that
requirement is the design constraint: *"Never silently fix financial records
without an audit trail."*

So every check reports, and the only mutation offered is
`rebuild_summaries`, which recomputes a **cache** from the immutable events.
Correcting the events themselves is a signed `record_adjustment` call made by
a human who has read the report.

Four classes of discrepancy, each of which has a real cause:

* **summary drift** — the cached rollup disagrees with the events. Cause: a
  crash between writing an event and rebuilding the summary. Harmless and
  self-healing, but worth seeing because a persistent one means the rebuild
  is not running.
* **negative usage** — adjustments have pushed a metric below zero. Cause: a
  double-issued credit. Financially significant: it means somebody was
  refunded twice.
* **orphan usage** — an event whose source entity no longer exists. Cause: a
  deleted call, or usage attributed to the wrong id.
* **period mismatch** — an event filed under a period whose bounds do not
  contain its timestamp. Cause: a subscription period changing after the
  usage was recorded, which is exactly what a mid-cycle upgrade does.
