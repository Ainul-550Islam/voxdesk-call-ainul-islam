"""
The entitlement service.

Requirement 4: route and agent code asks *this*, never `if tenant.plan ==
"pro"`. Requirement 26: the check happens **before** an expensive provider
action, not after.

The design question that matters here is what to do when a tenant is over
their allowance, and the answer is not one thing:

* **Overage enabled** → continue and meter. The customer agreed to pay for
  what they use.
* **Overage disabled** → refuse *before* the provider call. A trial that can
  run up a bill is not a trial.
* **Inbound calls** → never blocked. This is deliberate and is the one place
  the old code was actively harmful: it hung up on a dentist's patients
  because the dentist owed money. The customer being cut off is not the
  customer who owes us; the correct lever is the outbound and account-level
  features, not the phone line their patients ring.

Development is unlimited by an explicit switch, not by accident.
