/**
 * LEGACY — not mounted.
 *
 * Superseded by `pages/Overview.jsx`, which is fed by `/api/analytics/overview`.
 * Kept only so nothing that still imports it breaks; it is not reachable from
 * `App.jsx` any more. Delete once phase 2 confirms no consumer remains.
 *
 * The "Est. revenue captured" tile has been **removed rather than carried
 * over**. It rendered `estimated_value_usd`, which the server computes as
 * `booked * 150` -- a constant with no relationship to any appointment, lead
 * or invoice on the tenant's account. Presenting that as money is the single
 * most misleading thing the old dashboard did. The field still exists in the
 * `/tenants/{id}/stats` response so no API consumer breaks; it is simply not
 * displayed, and no replacement figure is invented in its place.
