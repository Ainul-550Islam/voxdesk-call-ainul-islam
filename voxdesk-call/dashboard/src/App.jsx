/**
 * The application root.
 *
 * STEP 8 phase 1: this file used to *be* the product — header, stat tiles,
 * call table and a transcript panel, all inline, on one screen. The Shell,
 * router and seven pages already existed in the tree but nothing imported
 * them, so none of it ran. This composes them.
 *
 * Responsibilities kept deliberately small:
 *
 *   1. own the session (`bootstrap`, `logout`, the 401 handler),
 *   2. build one `can()` from the server's permission list,
 *   3. resolve the current hash route to a page,
 *   4. refuse to render a page the account has no permission for.
 *
 * Everything else belongs to a page. The audit's F5 finding was that fetch
 * logic lived here; it now lives in `useApi`, and this file makes no data
 * request of its own beyond `/auth/me`.
