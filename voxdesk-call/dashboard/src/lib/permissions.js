/**
 * Frontend permission helpers.
 *
 * **These are UX, not security.** Hiding a button stops a manager from
 * clicking something that would 403; it does not stop anyone from calling the
 * API. Every one of these permissions is enforced again server-side by
 * `require_permission`, and that is the boundary that matters. The tests
 * assert both halves.
 *
 * Centralised so nothing writes `user.role === 'admin'` in a component --
 * requirement 20, and the reason is that a role check scattered across
 * twenty files cannot be changed when the policy does.
